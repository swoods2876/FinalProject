	   <b>Personal Artist Statment</b><br><br>A little background history is important to understanding some aspects of my work. I am a working artist who lost most of his central vision to a genetic disease (Stargardt's Disease) five years ago. Because I still have some peripheral vision, I can still paint, but must use some more tactile methods to complete a picture: for my paintings I use two pieces of masking tape to create each line, for my sheet metal wall hangings, I use rivets and a drip painting style that is loose and spontaneous. The rivets I can feel and the dripped paint does not require precision.
    That being said, I am now producing a series of works on paper (approximately 24 x 36 inches) based on my childhood memories and impressions of Plymouth, Massachusetts, particularly the watching of the arrival of the second "Mayflower" in 1957. These paintings, about 40 so far, use a variety of water-based paints, i.e. wall paint, tempera, gouache and milk paint. They are painted on chipboard and range in size from 24 X 36 inches to 22 X 30 inches. 
    Part of my personal aesthetic is to arbitrarily place limitations on myself. For example, I do not create colors by traditional mixing but rather 'find' colors, sometimes already mixed in the junk pile at hardware stores, and use them until they are gone and then replace them with a newfound color. I also mix my own colors with tints and white paint.
    There are reoccurring colors and shapes that I use in this series, and the paintings are done in an abstract manner. Although a finished piece is semi-representational. Other artists often assume these pieces are prints. I did major in printmaking in art school (SUNY-Purchase, '76-78) but these are all original paintings.
     Because I can't see my hands, directly, much less the brush, I use varying widths of tape to block out or delineate the areas or colors. The tape is eventually removed. This is certainly no invention of mine, but does allow me to be able to create a certain amount of detail, not otherwise possible.
    Recently, I have noticed my sight is worsening, so I must cast about for a 'new' material to work in, perhaps something more sculptural. I do not yet know what that might be but I have become so accustomed to arbitrarily placing limitations on myself that an outside limitation is not only ironic but kind of interesting. This grant will enable me to explore and purchase new materials to see if I can work in a new way. I would like to create several new pieces for the show at Bausch and Lomb that I have been invited to submit six pieces for. The wall space there is very large and I will have to create several larger works.
    P.S. I am a proud member of the Blind Artists Society(www.blindartistssociety.com)<br><b>Technique:</b><br>   Over the past few years I have become legally blind and have lost my central vision, due to late onset of a genetic disease called Stargardt's. Because of this handicap, I have had to change my working methods if not my style.
    To achieve the lines I want, I now use masking tape. Simply put, I lay down two pieces of tape side by side on the paper or canvas and fill the gap between them with paint applied with a brush. The closer the two pieces are to one another, the thinner the line. I manipulate tape to create curves. After the paint is dry, I removed the tape. 
     Masking with tape is nothing new to painters. What is different in my work is that there is an absence of a mechanical look. I am attempting to make expressive lines using mechanical means. All the lines in my work, with the exception of drips, are produced this way.
As far as peeling mediums, which I sometimes use, most of these are liquids that can be peeled, rubbed or chemically dissolved. These methods are fairly complex and demonstration is usually necessary for a true understanding of the process. I prefer masking tape.
